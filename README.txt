NETHIC, a software system for the automatic classification of textual documents based on hierarchical taxonomies and artificial neural networks. This approach combines the advantages of highly-structured hierarchies of textual labels with the versatility and scalability of neural networks, thus bringing about a textual classifier that displays high levels of performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
