Racism in sports has been a prevalent issue throughout the world, and in particular racism towards African-Americans has been especially bad over the course of the history of sports in the United States and around the world.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) released a report in 2007 claiming that racial abuse and vilification is commonplace in international sports, in places such as Australia, Europe, and America.
