Forget the cars, forget the house. There's whole lot more on stake. Forgot a life of shallow whims. there's a load of Hur on wait!

Holding fast and straing less, with knowledge of passing time. La ilaha illa Allah. Asking Him for the afterlife.

Moving on to worthy topics, leaving worthless speech behind. Laughing less and crying more, effect of the words of Allah at mind.
